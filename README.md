### Hey there!
I'm a full-stack web developer with a background graphic design and music. Having completed a web development boot-camp at the University of Denver in 2021, I'm ready to hit the ground running. Now trying to learn everything JavaScript related. Looking forward to combining all my talents to create unique and memorable experiences for the masses.
